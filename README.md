We have chosen to produce a Car Rental system i.e “Wheels-On-Rent”. In our system, Customer can rent a car based on make and a model. But a customer can rent a car if and only if he /she is a registered customer of our site however, a guest user can go through our site and view the car that are available. We provide a detailed information of the car that is available including all the accessories and rent per day. The customer can book a car and wait till receives a confirmation from the admin of our site. The registered customer can view their booking in their profile once they are logged in. The admin of the site can view all  the registered customers and also manage their booking.
